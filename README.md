# Week 7 Assignment Submission – University of Silicon Valley

This repository hosts the full set of documents for Michael Widener II's Week 7 assignment submissions in ENT525: Legal Structures, Contracts, and IP.

## Why this repo exists

Due to a platform timeout issue, I was unable to upload these documents via the school portal. I work the night shift ("graveyard") at Amazon and operate on a nocturnal schedule. 
Attempting to upload the day before (Saturday) would have caused significant physical disruption. 
This GitHub Pages repo is my workaround — a valid, ethical, and reasonable response under university policy.
